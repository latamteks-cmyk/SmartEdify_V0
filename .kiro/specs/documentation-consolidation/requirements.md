# Requirements Document

## Introduction

SmartEdify currently has extensive documentation spread across multiple files and directories with some redundancy and inconsistent organization. The goal is to consolidate and reindex all documentation into a cleaner, more maintainable structure that follows documentation best practices and improves discoverability for developers, operators, and stakeholders.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer joining the SmartEdify project, I want a clear documentation index and structure, so that I can quickly find the information I need to understand the architecture, setup, and contribute to the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer accesses the documentation THEN they SHALL find a single entry point (docs/README.md) that serves as a comprehensive index
2. WHEN a developer looks for architecture information THEN they SHALL find it consolidated in a single architecture.md file
3. WHEN a developer needs API specifications THEN they SHALL find them organized under a clear spec.md structure
4. WHEN a developer searches for testing information THEN they SHALL find all testing guidelines consolidated in testing.md

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want operational documentation clearly organized, so that I can efficiently manage CI/CD, deployments, and daily operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an operator needs CI/CD information THEN they SHALL find it in operations/ci-cd.md
2. WHEN an operator needs Docker setup information THEN they SHALL find it in docker.md
3. WHEN an operator needs runbooks THEN they SHALL find them organized under runbooks/ directory
4. WHEN an operator needs observability information THEN they SHALL find metrics, tracing, and dashboards documentation in observability/ subdirectories

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want security documentation consolidated, so that I can understand and maintain security policies, hardening procedures, and incident response.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a security engineer needs security policies THEN they SHALL find them in security/policy.md (based on SECURITY.md)
2. WHEN a security engineer needs hardening procedures THEN they SHALL find them in security/hardening.md
3. WHEN security documentation is updated THEN it SHALL maintain references to existing ADRs and runbooks
4. WHEN security incidents occur THEN relevant runbooks SHALL be easily discoverable from the security documentation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project manager or stakeholder, I want to understand project status and roadmap, so that I can track progress and make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a stakeholder needs project status THEN they SHALL find current status and roadmap in status.md
2. WHEN a stakeholder needs to understand feature parity THEN they SHALL find this information clearly documented in status.md
3. WHEN project status is updated THEN it SHALL maintain consistency with task tracking and technical documentation
4. WHEN roadmap changes occur THEN they SHALL be reflected in a single authoritative status document

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a maintainer of the documentation, I want to eliminate redundancy and ensure consistency, so that documentation maintenance is efficient and information is always up-to-date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is consolidated THEN duplicate information SHALL be eliminated
2. WHEN information exists in multiple places THEN it SHALL be moved to a single authoritative location with cross-references
3. WHEN documentation is restructured THEN existing links and references SHALL be updated or redirected
4. WHEN new documentation is added THEN it SHALL follow the established structure and indexing system

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As any user of the documentation, I want consistent formatting and navigation, so that I can efficiently find and consume information regardless of which document I'm reading.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing any documentation file THEN it SHALL follow consistent markdown formatting standards
2. WHEN navigating between documents THEN cross-references SHALL be accurate and functional
3. WHEN viewing the documentation structure THEN it SHALL match the proposed organization exactly
4. WHEN searching for specific topics THEN they SHALL be findable through the index structure
