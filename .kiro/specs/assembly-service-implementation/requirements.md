# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Assembly Service is a critical component of the SmartEdify platform that enables the execution of hybrid assemblies (in-person and virtual) in a legal, auditable, and transparent manner. Based on the existing plan and the current state of the SmartEdify ecosystem, this service needs to be implemented following the established patterns and integrating with existing services (Auth, Tenant, User) while maintaining the legal and compliance requirements for assembly management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the Assembly Service to follow the established SmartEdify patterns and integrate seamlessly with existing services, so that it maintains consistency with the platform architecture and leverages existing capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the Assembly Service THEN it SHALL follow the established service template structure (cmd/server, internal/app, internal/domain, internal/adapters)
2. WHEN integrating with other services THEN it SHALL use the established event-driven patterns with outbox and DLQ
3. WHEN implementing authentication THEN it SHALL integrate with the Auth Service using OIDC and JWT validation
4. WHEN managing tenant context THEN it SHALL integrate with the Tenant Service for membership and governance data
5. WHEN implementing observability THEN it SHALL follow the established OpenTelemetry tracing and Prometheus metrics patterns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement the Assembly Service incrementally starting with a minimal viable product, so that we can deliver value quickly while building toward the full vision.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting implementation THEN it SHALL begin with the Fast-track MVP scope (basic assembly creation, attendee registration, binary voting, basic minutes)
2. WHEN implementing the MVP THEN it SHALL include the core endpoints: POST /assemblies, POST /assemblies/{id}/attendees, POST /assemblies/{id}/votes, GET /assemblies/{id}/minutes
3. WHEN building the MVP THEN it SHALL emit basic domain events: assembly.created, assembly.attendee.registered, assembly.vote.cast, assembly.minutes.generated
4. WHEN implementing features THEN it SHALL follow the incremental phases defined in the roadmap (Preparation → Core → Accreditation → Voting → Minutes → Audit)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want the Assembly Service to maintain legal compliance and auditability, so that assemblies conducted through the platform are legally valid and can withstand legal challenges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating assemblies THEN the system SHALL validate agenda items and compliance requirements
2. WHEN managing voting THEN it SHALL implement anti-replay mechanisms using JTI tokens with TTL < 5 minutes
3. WHEN recording votes THEN it SHALL prevent double voting through voter/item locks
4. WHEN generating minutes THEN it SHALL create immutable records with digital signatures and timestamps
5. WHEN archiving data THEN it SHALL implement WORM (Write Once Read Many) storage for legal evidence

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an operations engineer, I want the Assembly Service to be observable and maintainable, so that I can monitor its health and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service is running THEN it SHALL expose health checks at /health endpoint
2. WHEN processing requests THEN it SHALL emit structured logs with trace correlation
3. WHEN handling operations THEN it SHALL expose Prometheus metrics for business and technical indicators
4. WHEN errors occur THEN it SHALL provide detailed error responses following the established error format
5. WHEN integrating with external services THEN it SHALL implement proper timeout and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want the Assembly Service to implement proper security controls, so that assembly data and voting processes are protected from unauthorized access and manipulation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authenticating users THEN it SHALL require JWT tokens validated against the Auth Service
2. WHEN authorizing actions THEN it SHALL implement RBAC based on tenant roles and assembly permissions
3. WHEN handling sensitive operations THEN it SHALL require step-up MFA for critical actions
4. WHEN storing data THEN it SHALL encrypt sensitive information at rest
5. WHEN communicating with external services THEN it SHALL use TLS 1.3 for all connections

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want the Assembly Service to have comprehensive testing coverage, so that we can ensure reliability and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing features THEN each component SHALL have unit tests with >80% coverage
2. WHEN creating API endpoints THEN they SHALL have contract tests validating the OpenAPI specification
3. WHEN integrating with external services THEN integration tests SHALL use mocks for external dependencies
4. WHEN implementing domain logic THEN it SHALL have comprehensive test scenarios covering edge cases
5. WHEN building the service THEN it SHALL include end-to-end tests for critical user journeys
